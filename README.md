# OOP-phrase-hunter-game

This game is a good example of using object-oriented programming principles in Python, including creating classes, defining methods, and managing attributes of objects.

At the start of the game, a random phrase is chosen and displayed as a series of underscore character placeholders, representing each letter in the phrase. The player then selects letters, and each time they make a guess, the program compares the letter with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, it is revealed in the display.

The player continues guessing letters until they either complete the phrase or make five incorrect guesses. If the player completes the phrase, a winning screen appears, and if they guess incorrectly five times, a losing screen appears.
